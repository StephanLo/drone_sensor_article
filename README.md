# Article Repository

Code and supplementary files for the study leading to an article called  
*"On the accuracy of an infrared-converted drone camera with Orange-Cyan-NIR filter for use in vegetation and environmental monitoring"*, 
submitted to [Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment]([https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/applied-computing-and-geosciences](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/remote-sensing-applications-society-and-environment)) (in Review).  

The article is prepared using Quarto, which allows for execution of code sections and text (styled using markdown).
The analysis was conducted using R 4.3, and all the R scripts used to generate results are visible in the Quarto document.

**Manuscript.qmd** is the Quarto source file. It is a text (markdown) file, so can be opened in a text-editor or IDE like RStudio or Visual Studio Code.
